MSc Cybersecurity professional with multi-domain exposure across penetration testing, detection fundamentals, governance & risk studies, and applied machine learning.

My work spans offensive security labs, defensive monitoring concepts, risk analysis, and analytical problem-solving through AI/ML projects. I focus on understanding systems holistically — from attack surface identification to security control evaluation and data-driven analysis.
