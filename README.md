I am an MSc Cybersecurity student focused on security monitoring, detection engineering, and incident response.  
My work centers on understanding how attacks manifest in logs and network traffic — and how to detect them efficiently within a SOC environment.

## Objective

To join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, where I can apply hands-on experience in log analysis, threat detection, and incident investigation while continuing to strengthen my blue team capabilities.
