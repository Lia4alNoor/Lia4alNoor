## 👋 Hi, I'm Lia

MSc Cybersecurity student with a research-driven approach to threat detection, infrastructure security, and system resilience.

I’m particularly interested in how cyber attacks translate into real operational impact — whether in enterprise environments, cloud systems, or critical infrastructure.
